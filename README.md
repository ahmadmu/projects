## Welcome to my Github repository, 
projects here are mainly JavaScript projects made using Angular and the MEAN Stack. The online version of these and other static websites I made can be found in my showcase:

A bit about me:
A Computer Science bachelor student who enjoys making things look great and function properly. Began making static websites, among other things, when I was 13 years old, but didn't start learning Javascript until 2014 at the beginning of my bachelor, and intensively getting into JS at the beginning of 2017 when I learned about node.js, ajax, Single Page Applications and how awesome they are. I also have background in Object-Oriented Java Programming.

Currently working as a translator/publisher semi-voluntarily for an amazing team with great people called [Afeefa.de](https://afeefa.de/), but also looking for opportunities to work on new projects and meet and work with new friendly people.
