## Welcome to my Github repository, 
projects here are mainly JavaScript projects made using Angular and the MEAN Stack as a preparation to get into the work market (or to just build some cool SPA projects. SPA is awesome). I've also worked on other, mainly university, projects that covered algorithms, design patterns, and ood design with UML git and Java (Spring), projects I'm not sure I can upload on a public profile like this repo.

Since 2014 I've been studying Computer Science with the focus on programming, and since March of 2017 I've been learning Javascript and diving deep into it, and I'm looking forward to learning more and more about the language and potentially dive into other related fields like Hybrid Application Development.

I'm currently working as a translator/publisher semi-voluntarily for an amazing startup with great people called Afeefa.de, and through my work there I've learned a lot about working in a team full of great web-developers, and mainly how to work towards something you want to do rather than something you have to do. However, I'm currently looking alongside that for a job as a junior developer, either as internship, or with a small group of people looking to build something, mainly to gather experience and meet and learn together.

## My Programming Knowledge/Experience:

bold is for languages I'm comfortable and have enough knowledge to program with 

- C & C++:   

API-usage, getting comfortable with basic programming, Algorithm implementations 

- **Java**  :   

WebApp using Spring (SalesPoint Framework+ git, scrum, and OOD Design w/ UML) 

- **Javascript** (ES6):    

jQuery, Angular(+TypeScript), Node.js, Express, MongoDB + other npm packages

In addition to: 

- *HTML5* : 

ejs scripts, thymeleaf scripts, jade 

- *CSS3*: 

scss, bootstrap

Also familiar with: php, relational databases/sql, hybrid web app dev (Ionic), wordpress
